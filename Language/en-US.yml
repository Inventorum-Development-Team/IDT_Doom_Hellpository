# ACT 1

  STR_PLAYER_INTRODUCTION: "CSO Briefing"
  STR_PLAYER_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Thank you for coming so fast, Chief. It's widely know that your role as the Chief Security Officer is usually related to Earth-based affairs, but we appreciate your involvement in the Martian endeavor. As you know, we have experienced certain clashes with rival companies that we need to keep in check here. But this is not the only reason why you are here. We made a recent xenopaleontology discovery and the Board of Directors have agreed to our request for an increase on security measures in order to properly assess the situation. All the UAC defense assets in Mars are now under your command, ground personnel and aircraft alike. Per standard procedure, your current Security Clearance is the lowest, as you should only expect to be engaged in riot-control tasks, but could be increased if needed."
  
  STR_THARSIS_STONE_PRIME_FRAGMENTS: "Tharsis Stone Prime Fragments"
  STR_THARSIS_STONE_PRIME_FRAGMENTS_UFOPEDIA: "Our survey teams looking for mineral assets in the volcanic region of Tharsis found several alien artifacts buried inside a cave that resembled an artificial sarcophagus. The pieces are made of a mineral not found in the periodic table and markings in the stone seem to be a combination of ancient human languages and pictographs, specially Sumerian. We must conduct additional research to understand the origin and purpose of this unknown message."
  
  STR_THARSIS_STONE_RESEARCH: "The Tharsis Stone"
  STR_THARSIS_STONE_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Our research efforts have concluded this alien table predates mankind by several million years yet somehow related to our race. The translation is not fully complete, but we could unravel significant mentions of some kind of 'invasion' or 'occupation' of the 'chosen grounds' where the fragments were found. We are led to believe Mars was visited by alien entities in the past and perhaps even saw a conflict in the distant past. We must focus on researching any further extraterrestrial assets found in the future, as we could obtain critical data of any potential energy source... or weapon."
  
  STR_ZOMBIE_INTEL: "Former Human Intel"
  STR_ZOMBIE_INTEL_UFOPEDIA: "These humans seem affected by a foreign pathogen that twisted their minds beyond recognition. Their pain receptors are completely disabled and their cognitive fuctions are reduced down to their most primitive levels. The few 'former humans' captured alive by other security teams reported they are completely unable to speak any human language and only emite grows and moans. Looks like they are lost beyond recognition."
  
  STR_BASIC_DEMON_INTEL: "Unknown Being Intel"
  STR_BASIC_DEMON_INTEL_UFOPEDIA: "The unknown beings we have encountered so far have a extremely distinct biology compared to anything cataloged in Earth so far. About communication... completely impossible, they seem to lack any kind of social skills. The good news, we can kill them. They seem slightly more resistant to our ballistic weapons than the regular armor-clad human, but we still can shoot them, punch them, kick them, stab them, explode them, rip them and tear them. Every corpse returned to base will be carefully analyzed to find their weaknesses and advantages."
  
  STR_ANCIENT_ENEMY: "Ancient Enemy"
  STR_ANCIENT_ENEMY_UFOPEDIA: "As further we delve into the topic, the more unusual findings we get. The autopsies carried on the alien beings killed by the security forces shed light on a particularly disturbing fact: by sharing the exact same composition with the Tharsis Stone, meaning they have been alive for millennia. It is very possible some of them were as old as the dinosaurs. We theorize they are natives to Mars and our mining efforts have awake them somehow. We must continue to research them as soon as we collect more samples. We count on you, Chief."
  
  STR_SECURITY_CLEARANCE_1: "> SECURITY CLEARANCE 1 <"
  STR_SECURITY_CLEARANCE_1_UFOPEDIA: "In light of the rising threat posed by the actions of illicit corporate competition and the increasingly abundant cases of violent insurrections, the Board has authorized you the use and deployment of heavy infantry support weapons to booster our security forces, plus specialized personal protection focused on engaging energy weaponry-wielding opposition."

# ACT 1 SIDEQUEST 

  STR_CORPORATE_COMPETITION: "Corporate Competition"
  STR_CORPORATE_COMPETITION_UFOPEDIA: "Despite being the largest corporation on Mars, we have competition from foreign companies based on Earth. Our strongest oponent is Togokahn Zaibatsu, the ruling Asian conglomerate. Their public motivation regarding their Martian endeavor is 'mineral extraction' but we strongly suspect they are involved in secret high technology development. So far from home, there is no effective way yo prevent clandestine operations, so we can expect some kind of harassment from them. And they can expect retaliation from us as well."
  STR_TOGOKHAN_ZAIBATSU_INTEL: "Togokahn Zaibatsu Intel"
  STR_TOGOKHAN_ZAIBATSU_INTEL_UFOPEDIA: "Founded in the late 19th Century, it saw an important rising after supporting the Japan government in the Third Sino-Japanese War, eventually becoming synonym with the Japanese regimen. Togokahn is practically involved in all kind of business in Asia, from public transportation to defense industries, including minery and aerospace development. This puts them in the unique position to challenge our off-world efforts, as they possess their own interplanetary fleet as well."
  
  STR_TOGOKHAN_ZAIBATSU_AGENT_INTERROGATION: "Togokahn Zaibatsu Agent Interrogation"
  STR_TOGOKHAN_ZAIBATSU_AGENT_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "The captured Togokahn agent was no match for our enhanced interrogation techniques. We confirmed what we suspected, before: TZ has direct links with the Yakuza, often having them in their payroll, specially for off-world operations. Lower ranks have lesser training, but they compensate it with the use of good quality equipment. We should not underestimate their courage, though, as most of them have seen combat since very young age. There is no need for further capture them."
  
  STR_TOGOKHAN_ZAIBATSU_LASER_REVERSE_ENGINEERING: "TZ Laser Reverse Engineering"
  STR_TOGOKHAN_ZAIBATSU_LASER_REVERSE_ENGINEERING_UFOPEDIA: "Recent skirmishes against Togokahn security forces made evident their advantage in the Laser development field. The high-powered energy weapons used against our Marines are definitely prototypes, not seen back on Earth... yet. By conducting reverse-engineering on their improved energy cells, we could adapt them to power our own lasers and gain an advantage over them."
