Notes
CIVm.PCK looks like standard civilian (not converted).
Pcks in the UFOGRAPH dir (SMOKE, X1) appear problematic.
Did not look at DAT files in GEODATA.
Didn't try to deal w/ Handobs or Floorobs.

The sprite-ids (aka frames) should be checked to see that/ ensure that their sequence is in synch with OxC's standard animation routines - that is, compare them against known-good spritesheets to see that the deathframes, facings, etc, line up identically ... for each doomset a routine will be chosen for.
